## Requirement

The final project as part of a Bootcamp course on frontend web development. For this challenge, utilising knowledge that's been accrued over the course of the bootcamp, this project is the initial scaffolding using React, Material UI, Framer-Motion and Leaflet & React-Leaflet. 

## Description

How much better can it get than knowing our wonderful planet by learning about the lovely places via a simple game!

The idea of the Geolocation game is to test a players geographical knowledge by dropping them into beautiful and magical places our world has to offer, on Google's street view map. The objective of the game is to explore the surrounding area and the specific monuments or nature and gather clues to deduce the location and use the world map and a draggable marker to guess the position of the monument. The app works out the difference in distance between the landmark and the users guess. In the current version, the computer randomly chooses a landmark and its just for fun, so no scoring system has been implemented. 

Technologies & Libraries used: React, Manipulating map tech via Leaflet & React-Leaflet, Animation via Framer-Motion, UI via Material UI.

## User-Story

As a player, I want to play and enjoy the geolocator game and discover beautiful and interesting places in the world.<br>

As a player, I want to see a street view of the place and be able to pinpoint my guess on the map.</br>

As a player, I want to play several times in a row.</br>

## Instructions

* The final project meets the following requirements

### Base Requirements

Uses ReactJS.

Deploys this application using Netlify.

Utilises at least two libraries, packages, or technologies not discussed at bootcamp
A polished front end/UI.

Meets good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)


## Links
Deployed application on Netlify: https://startling-mousse-8e06ad.netlify.app/

## Challenges

- Jumping from the frying pan and into the fire!
- Versions of react working harmoniously with versions of packages
- Deployment pipeline from desktop to netlify!

## Team

Sally, Sandra, Rod & Ranj made up the team, bringing in their expertise to bear. The technologies were new to all and so the learning curve was steep and true to form, the team stepped up to the mark!

## Acknowledgements
There were a large number people and organisations whose ideas and work was used in helping to develop this project. The initial inspiration for the look and feel for the app came from ![inspiration.](https://www.geoguessr.com). Many hours were spent pouring over others use of React with Leaflet, Material UI &  Framer-Motion, including a large number of YouTube videos! Certainly a labour of love.

## Future-Development
- Adding more locations, adding sections with different levels of difficulty (easy, moderate, difficult)</br>
- Adding a scoring system using zones</br>
- Expanding the app by adding a quiz  with country flags & capitals</br>
- Creating a multiplayer option with a lobby and a competitive element to the app</br>
